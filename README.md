CV Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mfalaize/cv-generator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mfalaize/cv-generator)
============

### Description

This application is a 100% javascript and HTML5/CSS website that fills the following requirements for your CV :

* Website templates.
* Automatic PDF generation.
* PDF templates.
* Easy localization.
* Centralized CV data for better maintainability.
* Module based architecture to easily create new website templates and PDF templates.

You can see a demo of a generated CV website [here](https://mfalaize.github.io/cv-generator/demo/).

Note that this application is mainly designed for developers but its architecture allows to enhance it for other jobs.

This application is provided with a GUI that let you generate easily your CV.

You can generate your CV from the GUI [here](https://mfalaize.github.io/cv-generator/) or download and install your own GUI.

You can see the application changelog [here](CHANGELOG.md).

### Guidelines for users

#### Getting started

To create your own CV, you can easily download the application, put it in your a web server (e.g. Apache Server) and launch the index.html with your favourite browser and let you guide by the generator.

Another way is to fork this repository and manually modify <code>cv/data/data_{yourLanguage}.json</code> (or create one from existing) and <code>cv/locale/locales.json</code>. The architecture of the json files should be easily understandable. Then change the picture present in <code>cv/img/identity.jpeg</code> by your own. Finally you just have to keep all the <code>cv</code> directory content and launch index.html from it.

That's all!

#### For manual edition (without the GUI)

##### Manage several languages

To add a language or modify the default language, edit the <code>cv/locale/locale.json</code> file.

##### Modify the templates

To change the HTML template, just change the value of the <code>model</code> key at the beginning of your <code>cv/data/data_{yourLanguage}.json</code> file. The value must match with a directory name present in the <code>cv/model</code> directory.

To change the PDF template, it is just the same as the HTML template. Just change the <code>pdfModel</code> value to match a js file name present in the <code>cv/pdfmodel</code> directory.

##### Customize the PDF rendering

You can choose what part of your CV you want to export in the PDF file. For that just put a <code>"displayOnPdf": true</code> in your <code>cv/data/data_{yourLanguage}.json</code> for each part you want to see in the PDF.

By default your work experience, education, pastimes and languages are not displayed.

### Fork

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt the content to your own. The following list suggests what types of improvements you can add to the application :

* Add a new supported language.
* Add a new website template.
* Add a new PDF template.

These improvements should be integrated to the project so if you develop one, please share it by sending a pull request! :)

To discuss other enhancements or report bugs/translation errors, please use the github issue tracker.

### Guidelines for contributors

#### Adding a new language

Nothing easier. Copy the <code>cv/locale/en.json</code> to <code>cv/locale/{yourLanguage}.json</code> and replace all values except the keys. Do the same with <code>locale/en.json</code> to translate the GUI. For the GUI, you also have to add your new language in <code>locale/locales.json</code>.

#### Adding a new website template

A website template is identified by its name. You have to give your template a unique name. To see what names are unavailables, see the <code>cv/model</code> directory content.

To create your template, start to create a directory with the template name in the <code>cv/model</code> directory. You can place all the content of your template inside.

Next you have to create two files : <code>{templateName}.html</code> and <code>{templateName}-head.html</code>. The first file will contain all of the HTML body content (without the ```<body>``` element). The second file will contain all of the template specific HTML head content (without the ```<head>```element).

Then you just have to develop your template as you want! Please just follow the same name convention for naming your <code>css</code> directory, <code>js</code> directory and <code>img</code> directory.

When your template is complete you finally have to update the GUI by adding your template in the options of the model field. To do so, edit the <code>data/data-fields.json</code>. Note that you can add custom properties (with custom new fields) as it is done with the default model (please see the JSON file to know how to do).

#### Adding a new PDF template

A PDF template is identified by its name. You have to give your template a unique name. To see what names are unavailables, see the <code>cv/pdfmodel</code> directory content.

To create your template, you have to create a js file with the name of your template.

Then you have to write your template into the ```pdfContent(cv, locale, img)``` function. The <code>cv</code> variable contains all of the json data written in <code>data/data_en.json</code> (or other file for other language). The <code>locale</code> variable contains all of the json data written in <code>locale/en.js</code> (or other file for other language). Finally the <code>img</code> variable contains the identity photo image.

As the PDF is generated with the jsPdf library, the <code>pdfContent</code> function must return the <code>jsPDF</code> object created at the beginning of the function. Your code should start by ```var doc = new jsPDF();```.

When your template is complete you finally have to update the GUI by adding your template in the options of the PDF model field. To do so, edit the <code>data/data-fields.json</code>. Note that you can add custom properties (with custom new fields) as it is done with the default model (please see the JSON file to know how to do).

#### Note for the <code>data/data-fields.json</code> file

When you edit the <code>data/data-fields.json</code> file, you also have to write a JS script in the <code>version/scripts</code> directory. This script is necessary to automatically adapt the saved CV files to the new model (as this file is only an angular model dump). The file name is important and have to be in the same template as <code>update-1.0.0-to-1.1.0.js</code>. If the script does not exist, just copy the <code>update-1.0.0-to-1.1.0.js</code> file, change its name and adapt its content. If the script already exists, just add your modifications to the content.
